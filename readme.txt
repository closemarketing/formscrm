Connects CRM with your Forms plugin and create new Leads/Entries as the forms are filled automatically.

== Description ==
Connects your CRM with the main Form Plugin directly, and send to your CRM when the form is filled automatically.

With this plugin, you don't have to use third party software to send your Leads/data to your CRM. You will have a direct connection between your website and your CRM. It's a connector between Web <> CRM.

This plugin will connect different Forms plugins to CRM. We support at this time these forms plugins:
- [GravityForms](https://close.marketing/likes/gravityforms/)
- WPForms (soon!)
- ContactForm7 (soon!)

If you need to support more Forms plugins, please contact in forum support.

The plugin setup is very easy. Once you have uploaded the plugin, you configure the plugin with the URL, user and password of the user that will create the entries in the CRM.

After that, you'll go to each form feed that you want to connect with the CRM. You will see a mapping fields where you choose for every field, the equivalent for CRM software field.

The plugin connects with the CRM via API webservice, a secure and best way to connect it. It *doesn't use a third party software*. You'll comply GDPR becaouse of not having a third provider.
